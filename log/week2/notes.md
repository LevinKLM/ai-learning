**Chapters:** 1.3-1.5

### 1.3 Kinds of Machine Learning Problems
### 1.3.1 Supervised Learning
  1. Classification
     * Which one? problem
     * Concepts: binary classification, multiclass classification, hieracrchical classification
  2. Tagging
     * Predict classes that are not mutually exclusive
  3. Search
  4. Recommender Systems
     * Key difference from search: personalization
     * Concepts: censored feedback
  5. Senquence Learning
     * Input/Output are in sequences
     * Example: Tagging and Parsing, Automatic Speech Recognition, Text to Speech, Machine Translation
